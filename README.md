# D205-Data_Acquisition

## Task_1

A common undertaking for a data analyst is to connect an external data collection to an existing data set.
This process involves the exploration of the source and target data sets to merge the new data in a
meaningful and logical way. 
You will replicate this common process in this task. You will take external data from a CSV file and design
conceptual, logical, and physical models that describe the data. You will load the new data into an existing
database alongside the existing data and run queries across it. 
The data sets, associated data dictionaries, and the CSV file are located at the Labs on Demand site where
you will work on this performance assessment. Please follow the Labs on Demand link in the Web Links
section.

A. Summarize a research question that can be answered using both the original database and the add-on
CSV data. The question should require data from both these data sources.   
1. Identify which data from the original data set and the add-on CSV file are needed to answer the
research question.

B. Create a logical data model for the add-on CSV file by evaluating the data contained in the file and
emphasizing the relational constraints.
1. Write SQL code that creates a table that accommodates the extension of the logical data model to a
physical data model by specifying the field types and relevant keys.
2. Write SQL code that loads the data from the add-on CSV file into the table created in part B1.

C. Write SQL statement(s) for a query or queries that inform the research question summarized in part A.
1. Provide a CSV file or files that capture the results from the query or queries.

D. Determine how often the add-on file should be acquired and refreshed in the database for the data to
remain relevant to the business and the research question.

E. Create an SQL script that performs the process of loading the add-on data.

F. Provide a Panopto video recording that includes a demonstration of the functionality of the code used
for the analysis and a summary of the programming environment.

G. Record the web sources used to acquire data or segments of third-party code to support the
application. Be sure the web sources are reliable.

H. Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased,
or summarized.

I. Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.
